I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had checked my configuration and the class names, but nothing seemed wrong.  The problem only occurred on certain components, and only in production, not during development.  I inspected the compiled CSS, and all classes were present, but the styles just weren't being applied to my elements.
