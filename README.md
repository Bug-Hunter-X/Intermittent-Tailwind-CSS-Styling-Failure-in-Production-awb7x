This repository demonstrates a rare bug in Tailwind CSS where styles fail to apply in production builds. The bug occurs intermittently and only affects specific components.  The core problem is related to unexpected CSS specificity conflicts or an unusual interaction between Tailwind's purging process and the application's structure. The `bug.html` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.html` provides a fix by utilizing important selectors (or a more robust CSS organization).  The issue is highlighted in the comments within the HTML.
